    <p><strong>This zip includes Nintendont and Wiiflow preconfigured to run
        backups from the SD Card in vWii.</strong></p>
    <p>I have made a chart that explains the different setups and what cIOS you
      would need for your own case.&nbsp;<a title="cIOS Chart" href="https://flumpster.lolcakes.com/cios.html">cIOS
        Chart</a><br>

        Zip</a></p>
    <div><span>
	  You must be on cIOS d2x-v10-beta52-vWii instead of d2x-v10-beta53-alt-vWii
      (beta52 instead of 53) to be able to run Wii backups off your SD Card.<br><br>
      If you are using USB then stick with 53(or the cIOS you need from the <a href="http://flumpster.lolcakes.com/cios.html">cIOS
      Chart</a>) and change the settings in Wiiflow to point to USB instead of SD.<br>
	  You can do this by clicking the Cogwheel icon in the bottom left in Wiiflow and clicking "Partition Settings", make sure they are all set to USB.<br>
	  Also click the bottom left button on Wiiflow(with a H) and then press the "Home" buton and change partition to USB.<br><br>
      (Check out the <a href="http://flumpster.lolcakes.com/cios.html">cIOS
      Chart</a> for your exact configuration.)</span></div></p>
	<p>Extract the contents of the <a href="http://flumpster.lolcakes.com/forums/Nintendont&Wiiflow.zip">Nintendont&amp;Wiiflow.zip</a>&nbsp;to
      the root of your SD Card (Formatted to Fat32). Also extract it to the root of your Fat32 Formatted USB if you intend to use one.<br>
	  Go into the Homebrew Channel on vWii.<br>
      Launch Wiiflow Lite.</p>
    <p>On first run of Wiiflow click the Cogwheel icon in the bottom left and go
      to page 2. Click on Startup Settings and change "Force Load cIOS" to "On". Also set your "Force cIOS Revision" to what you need by looking at the <a href="http://flumpster.lolcakes.com/cios.html">cIOS
      Chart</a>.<br>
      Click "Back" and it will restart Wiiflow, this could take a minute.</p>
    <p>If you get an error once restarted saying "No apps/wiiflow directory
      found" then you are on cIOS beta53 instead of beta52 (choose one of the
      following).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you want to use an SD card to store your Wii &amp; Gamecube backups
        then install cIOS beta52 (See Below).</li>
      <li>If you want to use a USB device to store your Wii &amp; Gamecube
        backups then extract the contents of the Nintendont&amp;Wiiflow.zip to
        the root of your USB Device plugged into the rear top port (Formatted to
        Fat32) or follow the <a title="cIOS Chart" href="https://flumpster.lolcakes.com/cios.html">cIOS
        Chart</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are 2 cIOS included, beta52 and beta53-alt.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>beta52 has better compatibility and works with backups on SD. The USB ports
        are not plug and play meaning you must insert them before launching
        Wiiflow.</li>
      <li>beta53 cannot play Wii backups from SD and has lower compatibility with Wii
        games than beta52.The USB ports are plug and play.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Included in the zip is a Wiiflow Forwarder Channel. This creates a
      channel(icon) on your vWii System Menu that will launch directly into
      Wiiflow instead of launching it thru the Homebrew Channel (Install
      Instructions Below).</p>
    <p>The Forwarder Channel will also allow you to go straight back into
      Wiiflow when you exit a game.</p>
    <p>If you have the Wiiflow Forwarder Channel installed then click the
      Cogwheel icon bottom left and go to page 4. Change the option "Return To
      Channel" to "Wiiflow Lite".</p>
